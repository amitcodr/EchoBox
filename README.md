# 📦 EchoBox

**EchoBox** is a lightweight Android library for collecting user feedback inside your app with zero friction.

Whether you're building a hobby app, an indie project, or a production app without heavy analytics tools, EchoBox lets your users quickly tell you what they think right from the app.

## ✨ Why use EchoBox?

Many users never leave Play Store reviews or open external support channels. EchoBox makes it easy to:

- Collect feedback **without leaving the app**
- Capture **emoji-based sentiment** (like/dislike)
- Let users write short feedback messages
- Automatically attach helpful context like app version and device info
- Send feedback via **email** no backend required

All in under a minute.  
No setup, no log collection, no complexity.

## 💡 Use Cases

- Quickly test how users feel about a new feature
- Let beta testers report issues without screenshots/logs
- Gather lightweight feedback on design changes
- Provide a fallback feedback option when no backend exists
